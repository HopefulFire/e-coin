# e-coin
A rails and javascript e-coin application

## Scope

This uses rails and vanilla object-oriented javascript to create the basics of a banking application (sort of). It isn't that impressive to look at, but it uses JSON Web Tokens to create a banking experience that with some coersion could be comparible to a normal non-api Rails application.

## Why & Why not a simpler game

This is mostly a bridge to React. Everything I do here is going to be different than my final project, so I wanted to challenge myself with finding documentation on the internet. I learned about JWT and how to authenticate users through an api. I saw another student's banking application and noted that it didn't have user authentication, so I sought to improve that in my design. I was, however late turning in my project and I think for future projects (namely the Final Project here at Flatiron) I will be more conservative and stick to what I know. However I do not regret my decision, as I learned a lot and it has potential to be improved in my portfolio later.
